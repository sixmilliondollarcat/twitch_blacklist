An open source blacklist for twitch bots.

## How to contribute

To add someone to this list, fork the repository and submit a pull request. If you wish to submit your entry anonymously, email it to six.m.cat@gmail.com and I will do it on your behalf.

## How to use

Open an XMLHttpRequest (or your programming language's equivalent) to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sixmilliondollarcat/twitch_blacklist/main/blacklist.json and use it to build your channel's ban list.

## In addition

Two things to remember:
* You can't buy yourself off the list. Be good and you won't get on it in the first place.
* This is not a mechanism for dealing with people you don't like. Proof of harassment or your pull request will be rejected.
